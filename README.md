## Description

This is an Cocoa (OSX), Objective-C category for `NSDate`. It gives `NSDate` the ability to report times like `"A moment ago"`, `"30 seconds ago"`, `"5 minutes ago"`, `"Yesterday"`, `"Last month"`, `"2 years ago"`, and so on.

This functionality has variously been referred to as a "time ago", "time since", "relative date", or "fuzzy date" feature.
